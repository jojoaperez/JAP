Joel Perez here, I'm a Cuban, American, middle aged man. My background is Forex Day Trader and Real Estate investing.
In the near future, I plan on becoming a blockchain developer/ financial analyst, along with different business ventures.
Reason why I choose Fintech as a career goal is because of where the banking sector is headed. I see it as a great opportunity to take advantage of, especially why its rather new.
